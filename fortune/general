Nerves stores all BEAM files on a read-only filesystem to minimize the chance of corruption.

Need to write to disk? Store your settings, databases, and logs under `/data`.

The NervesPack library pulls in useful Nerves dependencies. Trim your firmware by replacing it with only the dependencies you need.
%
Nerves uses a hardware watchdog to recover from Erlang VM and other hangs. https://embedded-elixir.com/post/2018-12-10-heart/
%
Make small code changes to your running application by copy/pasting Elixir source files at the IEx prompt.
%
Nerves uses the `boardid` program to read hardware serial numbers. Run `cmd("boardid")` and see
https://github.com/nerves-project/boardid
%
Nerves has small examples at https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_examples

Get some insights to Nerves internals with this high level overview of the
Nerves architecture and choice to use the BEAM VM. https://youtu.be/VzOaSvTcvU4
%
Nerves System is a lean Buildroot-based Linux that boots directly to the BEAM VM.
%
The default target is `host` unless you specify a different target in your environment.
https://hexdocs.pm/nerves/supported-targets.html
%
Different targets may support different ways to connect to your Nerves target device:
Ethernet, WiFi, USB-to-TTL serial cable, HDMI cable, USB data cable, etc
%
Downloaded Nerves artifacts are cached in `~/.nerves`. It is always safe to delete that directory to reclaim disk space.
%
Find supported features per target in the nerves_system_<target> documentation.
E.g., https://hexdocs.pm/nerves_system_rpi4
%
Nerves uses the Linux kernel but very little of the standard Linux userland.
%
The Nerves System dependency determines the OTP version running on the target.

The Nerves Project is spread over many repositories forcusing on a limited scope per repository.

%
Most Nerves projects use the VintageNet library for configuring the network.

%
The Toolshed package contains many useful commands. For info, run `h Toolshed`.
%
If you're used to the Linux commandline, many Toolshed helpers will seem familiar except with an Elixir twist.
For info, run `h Toolshed`.

Nerves includes a minimal version of busybox to support running simple shell
scripts and access network configuration utilities that do not have analogs in
Erlang/OTP.
%
When connecting to your target device using a USB-to-TTL serial cable or an
HDMI cable, and before booting up your device, you may see device messages
related to the booting process in the IEx console.
%
Get USB-to-TTL serial cable if not already. It is useful for debugging
networking or the boot process and for advanced development workflows.
